## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Data Scraping & Analysis:** Python, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Pandas
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Database:** SQLite

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git command-line tools

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-job-analyzer.git
    cd ai-job-analyzer
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    *This isolates the project's dependencies from your system-wide Python installation.*
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    *(Note: We will create this `requirements.txt` file together soon).*
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    *Navigate to the backend directory (if you create one) and run:*
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

5.  **Run the Frontend Application:**
    *In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and run:*
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application will open in your web browser.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.\n\nFrom your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.\n\nAbout the Team\n\n\u202f\n\nThe Advanced Development organisation pushes beyond the boundaries of product lines to build new things. We think independently of standard shipping cadences and timelines, working on foundational technologies that will impact every Roku device in the future, and on ideas that no one has seen before in their living room.\n\nWe\u2019re responsible for driving forward the architecture of Roku OS which ships worldwide, running on devices in more than 85 million streaming households. This work can include anything from optimising common libraries to redesigning the APIs and development environment used by third-party apps running on our platform. We work hard to ensure our software is optimised across a wide range of platforms and we\u2019re super focused on maximising customer experience.\n\nWe aren\u2019t kidding that Roku is a place where no one is a bystander. If you want to work on a team where you will be surrounded by the best talent-building things used by millions of people, if you want a tech culture that just works, you should reach out.\u202f\n\nAbout the role\u202f\n\nAs a Senior Software Engineer you\u2019ll be an embedded expert at C++ and C, able to understand complex systems and design changes that unlocks new capabilities and has significant benefits for future engineering efficiency. You\u2019ll be able to profile and analyse systems to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, especially on low-cost hardware. You\u2019ll be adept at partnering with other teams to identify requirements and pain points, and to create collaborative solutions.\n\nYou\u2019ll be designing, implementing and testing parts of Roku's\u202fnative development kit which exposes fundamental APIs\u202ffor the Roku platform. These APIs are used both externally and internally by teams to build higher level SDKs. You\u2019ll be passionate about the high-level vision for these APIs, and eager to get coding and implement this vision, driving usage of these APIs across our codebase to increase modularity and testability.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll be doing\n\u2022 Designing, implementing and testing native development kit APIs for a multi-process environment that are fast, efficient and maximise platform flexibility\n\u2022 Demonstrating excellence in C++ and C development by delivering high-performance, ultra-reliable software\n\u2022 Digging deep to find solutions to new and challenging problems, using data to drive your decision making\n\u2022 Working alongside many software development teams to make improvements to Roku OS modularity and scalability\n\nWe\u2019re excited if you have\n\u2022 8+ years in software development, architecture, and API design\n\u2022 5+ years Linux systems programming\u202f\n\u2022 Excellent C and modern C++ programming skills\u202f\n\u2022 Proven track record developing software operating within tight resource constraints\n\u2022 Excellent collaboration and communication skills\n\u2022 Bachelor\u2019s and/or master\u2019s degree in computer science or equivalent\n\n#LI-SS5\nBenefits\n\nRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter.\n\nThe Roku Culture\n\nRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.\u202f\n\nWe have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.\u202f\n\nTo learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.\n\nBy providing your information, you acknowledge that you have read our Applicant Privacy Notice and authorize Roku to process your data subject to those terms.",

      "description": "Simple isn\u2019t easy. We should know.\n\nDuring 20+ years of delivering financial planning and analytics products that are simple to use, we\u2019ve overcome numerous complex challenges. We\u2019ve had plenty of failures, but from each one we try to learn and push forward with an alternative approach. This is how we've stayed at the leading edge, creating products that are changing the way the world works.\n\nTo help us stay at the leading edge, we\u2019re looking for a senior software engineer with experience creating products that use off-the-shelf AI/ML tools such as large language models (LLM). You\u2019ll work as part of an exceptionally talented cross-functional team building tools that make our customers and employees more productive. Recently, the team created a way for users to get answers from our analytics product by asking questions in natural language. They also developed a tool that provides feedback on SQL written by our integration teams.\n\nAs for what\u2019s next, who knows? We have no preconceived ideas, and the role will be heavy on experimentation and iteration as we search for the best ways to help our customers and to differentiate our products. We could be automatically categorising our customers\u2019 transactions. Or forecasting our customers\u2019 budgets. Or something completely different.\n\nQuestions you\u2019ll be asking (and hopefully answering) include:\n\u2022 What\u2019s the best way to prompt an LLM so that it answers a user\u2019s query?\n\u2022 Our AIs run against vast and unique customer datasets, so how can we give an LLM the right amount of domain knowledge to set it up for the best chance of success?\n\u2022 How do we know whether improving the AI\u2019s behaviour in one area has negatively affected its behaviour in another?\n\u2022 The area of AI is progressing at breakneck speed - is there anything new that we could use?\n\u2022 What should we try next?\n\nFor us to excel in this area we need to fuse the very best product management approach with the very best engineering approach. You will be particularly successful in this role if you have a talent for thinking with a product mindset as well as an engineering mindset. But we don\u2019t expect you to know it all already. In all our roles, learning and development is as critical to our success as it is to yours, so we set aside time for you to spend on your personal development.\n\nWhat we're looking for:\n\u2022 6+ years of experience working on complex software products, preferably ones that process large quantities of data.\n\u2022 A confident, experienced senior engineer who can devise, communicate and implement well-informed technical solutions, thrives on ambiguity and is happy exploring an emerging domain.\n\u2022 A track record of building products that are backed by off-the-shelf AI/ML tools. If you also have data science experience then we\u2019d love to know.\n\u2022 A strong history of working with cloud-based infrastructure (preferably Amazon AWS).\n\u2022 Good knowledge of C# is essential \u2013 TypeScript and SQL would be a nice plus.\n\u2022 A creative approach to problem solving.\n\u2022 Enthusiasm, passion, a willingness to learn, and a growth mindset.\n\u2022 A sense of fun and a genuine desire to work as part of a diverse and collaborative team that is empowered to make decisions.\n\nWhat's in it for you?\n\u2022 Dedicated time for learning and development each fortnight\n\u2022 Benefits include life cover, income protection insurance and subsidised health cover\n\u2022 Work with some of the best tech talent in Christchurch\n\u2022 Central location with free parking and easy motorway access\n\u2022 Flexible hybrid working policy\n\nGenerally Phocas is a strong supporter of international talent, however due to current visa settings and processing times, at present we are only considering applicants who hold NZ working rights for this position.\n\nMore about Phocas\n\nOver the past 20 years Phocas has grown from a UK-based startup to a global organisation with nearly 300 employees around the world, headquartered in Sydney, with a Product & Development team here in Christchurch.\n\nPhocas helps people feel good about data by doing the hard work for them. We offer a range of products that enable our customers to quickly and easily analyse data from multiple sources, discover insights, and share reports. Our solutions are used by around 30,000 people in businesses across a wide range of industries. We change the way people think and work, and make it easier for them to be decisive and operate with confidence. We pride ourselves on our customer-centric approach and are committed to delivering high-quality software that meets the evolving needs of our clients.\n\nWe are a 2024 Circle Back Initiative Employer \u2013 we commit to respond to every applicant\n\nTo all recruitment agencies: Phocas does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to our jobs alias, Phocas employees or any other company location. Phocas will not be responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes.\n\nPhocas is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer.

Even if you do not meet all of the preferred qualifications and skills listed in the job description, we encourage candidates to apply. If your career is just starting, hasn\u2019t followed a traditional path, or includes alternative experiences, don\u2019t let it stop you from applying.\n\nWhy AWS?\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. We pioneered cloud computing and never stopped innovating \u2014 that\u2019s why customers from the most successful startups to Global 500 companies trust our robust suite of products and services to power their businesses.\n\nInclusive Team Culture\nHere at AWS, it\u2019s in our nature to learn and be curious.

When we feel supported in the workplace and at home, there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t achieve in the cloud.\n\nHybrid Work\nWe value innovation and recognize this sometimes requires uninterrupted time to focus on a build. We also value in-person collaboration and time spent face-to-face. Our team affords employees options to work in the office every day or in a flexible, hybrid work model near one of our New Zealand Amazon offices.\nWhat's it like to work at Amazon Web Services?

Three decades later, Ramsey Solutions is a household name in personal finance, with a mission to change the toxic money culture for good.\n\nOur Mission: Ramsey Solutions provides biblically based, commonsense education and empowerment that give HOPE to everyone in every walk of life.\n\nHere\u2019s a Taste of Our Benefits:\n\u2022 Health insurance (includes plans eligible for an HSA\u2014with a company match up to $500!)\n\u2022 401(k) retirement plan with 4% match/company contribution\n\u2022 Annual wellness, counseling and grocery membership reimbursement\n\u2022 On-campus cafe with subsidized pricing for breakfast, lunch and coffee bar\n\u2022 Dependent care FSA\n\u2022 Tons of cultural activities, like weekly devotional, leadership development courses, Battle of the Bands, and one epic Christmas party!\n\nWhere and How You\u2019d Work:\n\nRamsey Solutions Headquarters is located just outside of Nashville in Franklin, Tennessee. We value our strong, unified company culture because we believe the best work is done together. That\u2019s why all of our team members work on-site under the same roof. But work-life balance is also important to us, so we offer flexible work schedules to take the stress out of appointments, family obligations and other needs that may pop up.\n\nWhile every team member has a designated workspace (with an electronic sit-stand desk), our campus was designed to house a variety of unique work and play zones (e.g., quiet library space, coffee bar/lounge areas, recreational game zone, and outside/patio work and break areas).\n\nWhat You\u2019d Do in This Role:\n\nYou will oversee and innovate within critical areas, including our AWS organization, network architecture, and software build infrastructure. As a key member of this team, you will play a pivotal role in ensuring our systems are scalable, secure, and primed for the future of technology.\n\nYou\u2019re Probably a Match If:\n\u2022 You have 3+ years of in-depth knowledge of AWS infrastructure or equivalent experience with Azure or GCP.\n\u2022 You have 2+ years of hands-on experience with CDK, Terraform, or Pulumi for infrastructure as code.\n\u2022 You have proven expertise in building, deploying, and optimizing cloud architectures in a production environment.\n\u2022 You have a passion for continuous learning and growth, with the ability to collaborate effectively with other world-class Cloud Engineers.\n\nWhat Winning Looks Like:\n\u2022 Help restore Ramsey\u2019s Cloud infrastructure during outages. Helps ensure architecture is designed in a highly available way. Collaborating and partnering with teams across Product Engineering\n\u2022 Build a self-service platform for dev teams to quickly create life changing products\n\u2022 Build automation for tasks that the Systems team is spending too much time on, thus freeing the team up to work on bigger and more important problems. Iterating on solutions we're building following CI/CD principles\n\nOther Stuff to Know:\n\nWe\u2019re looking for people who are passionate about our mission. This isn\u2019t just a J-O-B. We experience resistance every day because what we believe is absolutely countercultural. We actually hate debt. We actually cut up our credit cards . . . like, for real. Some of us are still fighting our way out of debt, but we aren\u2019t going back. If you don\u2019t know much about Ramsey Solutions and our founder, Dave Ramsey, we encourage you to download the Ramsey Network mobile app and consume our content.\n\nIf Ramsey Solutions sounds like a workplace where you can get excited about Mondays, apply today. We can\u2019t wait to hear from you!\n\nEOE, including disability/vets",

      "description": "It's no secret that traditional site reliability teams struggle to keep pace with manual monitoring, reactive troubleshooting, and labor-intensive deployments. The rise of AI presents a solution, but many companies fail to fully leverage its potential, resulting in systems that underperform and bottlenecks that stifle innovation. Data shows that 73% of companies struggle with deployment delays and operational downtime, primarily due to outdated processes and lack of AI-driven automation.At IgniteTech, we are tackling these issues head-on by building AI-first cloud solutions that are designed to anticipate and prevent problems before they arise. We focus on integrating AI and machine learning into every facet of cloud infrastructure management, from automated monitoring systems to intelligent CI/CD pipelines. This approach creates environments that not only self-heal but also continuously evolve, reducing downtime, improving performance, and pushing the boundaries of what cloud services can do.This isn\u2019t your typical site reliability role, where you'd be reacting to problems and manually intervening when things go wrong. Here, you\u2019ll lead the charge in building AI-enhanced monitoring systems that detect and resolve 95% of issues before they ever reach end users. You\u2019ll also architect and manage AI-automated CI/CD pipelines that reduce deployment times by 30% while slashing manual interventions. The ideal candidate thrives in an AI-driven environment, is excited by the prospect of automation-first solutions, and enjoys pushing the envelope of cloud infrastructure design.In this role, you\u2019ll join a global team of innovators who are redefining cloud infrastructure.
